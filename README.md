# **Ethereum-Based Voting System**
The Ethereum-Based Voting System is a decentralized and transparent solution for conducting secure elections. By leveraging Ethereum's blockchain technology, this system ensures that voting records are tamper-proof, votes are anonymous, and the process is fraud-resistant. It eliminates the need for intermediaries, making elections trustworthy and efficient.

# ** Features**
Secure Authentication: Implements JWT for voter authentication and authorization.
Blockchain Integration: Uses Ethereum blockchain for transparent and immutable voting records.
Trustless Process: Eliminates intermediaries for a self-verifiable voting mechanism.
Admin Panel: Manage candidates, configure voting dates, and monitor results efficiently.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for voters to cast votes and view candidate information.
